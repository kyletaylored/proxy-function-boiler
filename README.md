# Basic API Proxy for Cloud Services

## Google Cloud Function Proxy

This repo is a basic proxy function to connect to an external API.

# Getting started for local testing

1. Clone down the repo.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```
1. In your console, start the service:

   ```
   $ npm run start
   ```

   > **NOTE**: the service will start on `localhost:8001` by default. You can change the port in `package.json` under `scripts/start`.

1. Issue a test request:
   ```
   $ curl localhost:8001/authenticate
   ```

# Creating a local domain

When running locally (`npm run start`), a localhost service is running, but this address can't be used in Drupal to ping requests to, and you will run into a `Connection Refused` error. To bypass this, we need to give the service an actual domain. To do this easily, we can utilize [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set up a temporary tunnel.

1. Install Ngrok:

```
brew cask install ngrok
```

1. Ensure the local service is running (i.e `localhost:8001`):

```
npm run start
```

1. In a new terminal session, pipe the localhost to Ngrok:

```
ngrok http http://localhost:8001
```

1. Ngrok will provide forwarding addresses than can then be used for testing in Drupal:

```
Forwarding                    http://dc1b6c7f.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8001
Forwarding                    https://dc1b6c7f.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8001
```

# Environment variables

There is a single environment variable utilized in the `.env` file in the root of the project:

```
PROXYURL='https://api.example.com/v2'
```
